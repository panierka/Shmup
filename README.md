# Shmup
Shoot 'em up game written in C++ with SFML library.

## Rules
Player has to shoot down hordes of monsters, before they travel to the bottom of the screen, while simultaneously doding dangerous attacks in a bullet-hell style scenario. 
Enemies can be fought with two distinct modes of attacking, a precise gun and a chaotic shotgun, which complement each other and reward good reflexes and smart decision making. 
There is also "reinforcement" mechanic, where player can reload their gun and temporarily enter a parry state, in which each damage taken instead results in healing - 
player has to use it smartly to refill their resources and be wary of its cooldown.
After each wave a reward will spawn, oferring 3 distinct upgrades to choose from for boost in later gameplay.
